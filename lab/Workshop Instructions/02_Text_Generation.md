# Part 1 - Text Generation

Welcome to Part 1 of this workshop, where we'll be interacting with GPT-4o model to generate text.

> [!TIP]
> What is prompt engineering?
> Prompt engineering is a concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves **embedding descriptions of tasks** in input to **prompt the model** to output the **desired results**.

## Basic prompting

Let's start with a few prompts and observe the response using the chat playground. To use the chat playground, follow the following steps:

![image showing the chat interface](./Images/ai-studio-basic-prompting-v2.jpg)

1. In Project playground section, on the left-hand navigation bar, navigate to the available tools and select **Chat.** 
2. In the Chat playground, find the text box labeled _"Type user query here."_
3. From the prompt examples below, copy the sample prompt provided e.g., ``here is a sample prompt``and paste it to the text box.
4. After adding your prompt, locate the Paper Plane icon, usually positioned next to the input box. Click on the Paper Plane icon to submit your text to the model deployment.
5. After sending your query, wait a moment for the model to process and respond. The response will appear in the chat window below your input.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you receive an error message indicating "you have exceeded token rate limit", wait one minute and then try again.


Here are some examples to try, but get creative with your own prompts and see what happens!

### Website copy and conversation history

```
Suggest a tagline for the website landing page of an e-commerce for outdoor clothing and equipment called Contoso Outdoor Company.
```

Without clearing the chat history, try now the following prompt:

```
Generate website copy for the homepage of the e-commerce website.
```

Note that the model is providing a copy for the *Contoso Outdoor Company* website, even if we didn't specify again the company name or business. This is because under-the-hood the model is given the **whole conversation history** as context, not just the latest prompt. An AI model cannot learn and has no memory of previous interactions if the user leaves and comes back, but the application is using prompt engineering to add this 'memory'.

> [!NOTE]
> You can control the context window size, which is the number of previous interactions that the model will consider as context (default is 10) by going into the **Parameters** tab.

You can control your model parameters as follows:

![image showing parameters tab](./Images/ai-studio-parameters.jpg)

1. In the Chat interface, navigate to the **Parameters** tab.
2. Once in the Parameters tab, adjust the setting controls. You can change the number of past messages included which the model will consider as context. Once set, the changes will be applied automatically.


### Summarization and key entities extraction

The resulting copy we have got from the previous step is already a good starting point, but it might be too long for a landing page. Let's try to get a shorter version of it.

Text summarization is a well-known capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). It creates a short summary of a larger piece of text.

> [!TIP]
> To summarize, you can add tl;dr (for "too long; didn't read") to your prompt, followed by the text you want to summarize.

Moreover, you can also instruct your LLM to extract key information from text. In our scenario, this is useful to get keywords for **SEO optimization**.  Try the following prompt to summarize the previous copy, followed by extracting useful data.

```
1. tl;dr
2. Extract company name, categories of products and business unique values from the long description above.
```

## Advanced prompting

### Zero-shot learning

LLMs are trained on such large amounts of data they may be able to perform some tasks with very little prompting. This is known as **zero-shot learning**. For example, let's ask the model to generate a list of product names and to categorize them:

```
Create a list of 10 product names the Contoso Outdoor shop might sell, include the type of item.
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before moving on with the next section, click on the **Clear Chat** button to clear the message history.

### Few-shot learning

If zero-shot learning is failing for your examples and more complex tasks, **few-shot prompting** can provide examples that can better steer the model to the desired outcomes. Examples show the model clearly how we want it to operate. Here's an example of a few-shot learning prompt for categorizing products.

```
Create a list of 10 product names the Contoso Outdoor shop might sell, include the type of item.

Examples:  
RidgeRunner Pro Trekking Poles: EQUIPMENT  
SummitShield 3-Season Tent: EQUIPMENT  
CascadeTech StormProof Jacket: APPAREL  
TerraFirm 40L Daypack: EQUIPMENT  
AlpineGlow Solar Lantern: EQUIPMENT
```

### Chain of thought prompting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you start, click on **Clear Chat** to avoid any context from previous interactions.

When interacting with LLMs, a useful tip is to imagine that you are speaking to an untrained intern. So the more details you can provide about the task to be performed, the better the results you will get. In particular, a useful strategy is to break down the task into smaller parts and provide a prompt for each part. Let's try this with the website copy generation task.


```
You will generate the website copy for the homepage of the Contoso Outdoor Company e-commerce website.
Instructions:
- Write a short welcome message for the homepage, specifying the company name and the main value proposition.
- Write a brief description of the business, including the categories of products offered.
- Write a short description for each of the following product categories: tents, backpacks, hiking clothing, sleeping bags.
```

Another option is using a technique - called **chain of thought** where the LLM is responsible for breaking the task down into smaller steps. The LLM uses its knowledge of the world and its ability to reason. The LLM then generates a chain of thoughts that lead to the solution of the task.
Clear the playground chat again and then enter the user prompt below to see 'Chain of thought prompting' in action:

```
Generate the website copy for the homepage of the Contoso Outdoor Company e-commerce website.
Take a step-by-step approach in your response, include a welcome message, a brief description of the business, and a description of the product categories offered (tents, backpacks, hiking clothing, sleeping bags). Also, give reasoning before sharing the final answer in the below format: ANSWER is: <website copy>.
```

## System message and added knowledge

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before moving on with the next section, click on the **Clear Chat** button to clear the message history.

### System message

> [!TIP]
> What is the **system message**? The system message is used to communicate instructions or provide context to the model at the beginning of a conversation. It is displayed in a different format compared to user messages, helping the model understand its role in the conversation. The system message typically guides the model's behavior, sets the tone, or specifies desired output from the model. By utilizing the system message effectively, users can steer the model towards generating more accurate and relevant responses.

![image showing system message tab](./Images/ai-studio-system-message.jpg)

Update the System Message to give the model instructions and context as follows:

1. In the Chat interface, navigate to the **System message** tab.
2. Once in the System message tab, erase the existing message. Click inside the System message field to place your cursor there and  insert the text below:

```
## Task
You are a web copywriter for the Contoso Outdoor Company e-commerce website. Your goal is to generate the website copy for the homepage. 
Your answer should be brief and engaging. Always use a friendly and professional tone of voice.
Always show the word CONTOSO in capital letters.

## Safety
In the copy you write always stick to the subject of the company and the products it offers. Avoid any irrelevant information and controversial opinions.
```

3. Find the button labeled Apply changes, it is located directly above the System message tab and will be highlighted with a blue background. Click this button to save and apply the changes youâ€™ve made to the System message field.
4. After applying the changes, click update in the pop-up to update the system message.


Observe that we have provided the model with a **clear task**, a **tone of voice**, and **safety measures** to follow. Your model, like any piece of technology used for business, is like your brand. If you want it to have the same approach and ethics you instill in your code of conduct across the business, it should also be included in your AI solutions. Setting a segment around tone within your system message can help to set the response type to suit your use case.

The text provided in the System Message is handled specially by the model, and is intended to have more influence on the model's responses than the User Message text or other context provided in the prompt. Also, it is persisted across all the interactions in the chat, even if you clear the chat history.

5. To see how the model's behavior changes with the added context, try the prompt below in the text box:

```
Write a brief description of the business, including the categories of products offered.
```

You will see that not only does the model respond with the requested information, but it also follows the tasks accurately, such as writing CONTOSO in capital letters. To go further, we can test the **safety measures**: 

```
What are your thoughts on the upcoming election?
```

6. The model will refrain from answering this (as it is both irrelevant to the company and could be deemed controversial), and stick to the subject of the company and its products.

### Grounded prompting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure to **Clear Chat** before moving on with the section.

In the website copy we have generated so far, the model has been creative in inventing a business value proposition and product offering. However, in real-world scenarios, we want the model to generate text that is grounded in reality and reflects the actual business. To achieve this, we can use a technique called **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This technique involves providing the model with a set of facts or information about the business, which the model can then use to generate more accurate and relevant text.

> [!NOTE]
> **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI technique that combines a language model with a search system to provide more accurate and detailed information. In a RAG pattern, the system usually retrieves relevant information from a database and then uses it to help generate more informed and contextually accurate text responses. For the sake of this lab, we will simulate the retrieval process, by providing the model with a set of facts about the business in the prompt.

Added knowledge can be provided always through the System message. So, let's update the System message. Clear the existing system message and insert the information below and then click **Apply changes**.
